Catching a Wave
This summer in California, I found out how much fun surfing was.
First, I took a lesson on the beach. 
Then, I paddled out into the ocean and began to watch the waves. 
At just the right moment, I popped up on my board and rode it to shore. 
It was so exciting, and I couldnâ€™t wait to try it again!
